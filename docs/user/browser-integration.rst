Browser Integration
===================

**Gthnk** runs a private web server that only you can connect to.
There are a few browser tricks that make it easier to get extra use out of **Gthnk**.

Google Chrome
-------------

Search Bar
^^^^^^^^^^

1. In chrome, visit chrome://settings
2. Click *Manage search engines...* (or click chrome://settings/searchEngines)
3. Scroll to the bottom of the list of search engines and *Add a new search engine*
    1. call it "gthnk"
    2. use a simple keyword like "j" for journal
    3. paste the following: http://localhost:1620/journal/search?q=%s

Now you can quickly search the journal in the search bar.  For example, if you knew you saved a URL in the last week, you might type the following in the search bar:

::

    "j http"

That would search **Gthnk** for anything matching *http*, which would hopefully find the URL you bookmarked.

App Launcher
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Enable the necessary Chrome flags
    1. chrome://flags
    2. chrome://flags/#bookmark-apps - Enable
    3. chrome://flags/#disable-hosted-apps-in-windows - Enable
2. Add Gthnk as an App
    1. Navigate to http://localhost:1620/journal/live
    2. Click the 3-dot "more" tool button
    3. Click "More Tools"
    4. Click "Add to Applications"
    5. Call it "Gthnk"
3. Done

Chrome Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method has been replaced by the App Launcher, which is better...

The **Gthnk** Google Chrome extension enables **Gthnk** to be launched from the menu bar using the Chrome Launcher.

1. Download the extension code from github

::

    git clone https://github.com/iandennismiller/chrome-app-gthnk.git

2. Open chrome://extensions/ in your browser
3. Check *Developer mode*
4. Click *Load unpacked extension...*
5. Navigate to gthnk/integrations/chrome-app
6. Click *OK*

Now, you have an icon that will launch **Gthnk**.

Hotkey
^^^^^^

I use Spark.app to create a hotkey pattern for launching the Gthnk app.

Many launchers will work, but the important part is that you must create an "App Launcher" for Gthnk before the hotkey can be created.

Steps for adding a Gthnk hotkey:

1. Click the gear icon to drop down the list of things to create
2. Choose `Application`
3. Set a unique shortcut key combination
4. name it `Gthnk`
5. Action: `Launch`
6. Choose: locate the gthnk chrome app
    1. Navigate to wherever your apps are and looks for `Chrome Apps`
    2. On OS X, this is probably `/Applications/Chrome Apps`
    3. Select `Gthnk` in the `Chrome Apps` folder
7. Done

Other Browsers
--------------

Since **Gthnk** is provided as a web server, you can use any browser to connect to it.  If you craft integrations for other browsers, please `create an issue <https://github.com/iandennismiller/gthnk/issues>`_ that describes your process and we can add it to this document.
