Contributing
============

Gthnk welcomes contributions from the community.
The most important theme for Gthnk contributions is *communication*.
An open source project thrives when communication is healthy.

Here are examples of some ways you can help:

- Extend and clarify the documentation
- Internationalization; help with translations
- Software Development

Help with the documentation
---------------------------

Project documentation is one of the most important aspects of an open source project.
You can help immensely by editing the current documentation for clarity.
You can find the documentation in the `Gthnk repository <https://github.com/iandennismiller/gthnk/>`_, which you can modify by submitting a pull request.

Internationalization
--------------------

Can you help localize Gthnk for a new language?
We can use help translating the software, websites, and documentation.

Software Development
--------------------

Gthnk is an open source project.
If you know Python, please see the :doc:`developer` document for more information.
